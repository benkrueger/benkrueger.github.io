# Notes
#### This page is meant to archive markdown notes from my coursework. I am doing this for a few reasons:
- Backing up my notes to a readily available format.
- Practicing markdown skills and note taking abilities.
- So I can go back and reference old class material.
- Enhancing my own understanding of course material by publishing my reinterpretation of the material. 

## Is this allowed?
*There will be no material from any of these classes directly copied to this website. Only my own interpretation of the class material as outlined in my notes will be on here.*
